<p>This cake I made for a friend's sister's birthday :) It was quite a challenge. There are dozens of real strawberries I implemented 
into the buttercream icing mixture, which gave it such a unique and interesting texture, and also in the cake layers itself! The cake 
layers were a light pink and were strawberry flavored with real strawberries, extract, and syrup from the fruit. The icing between the 
layers was a chocolate buttercream and to match that I added chocolate covered strawberries on top with that chocolate
ganache. Whenever I show someone one of my cakes, this seems to be the one to get the best reaction. Thanks for looking!</p>
