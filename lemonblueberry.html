<p>This cake I made for my sister's college graduation. We rented out an AirBnB to celebrate on the shore of Kiawa island in Charleston, SC
and it was during the summer, so the two bright flavors felt very appropriate for the setting. This cake was also 
complete homemade. I spent about 6 hours making the cake mix and icing it at home and then went to the airbnb to make the blueberry syrup
for the blueberry topping along with the lemon zest. And for a surprise, there were tons of real blueberry in the cake layers itself!</p>
