<p>This cake I made for my friend's grandmother. It was completely homemade and took a total of 9 hours. 
The cake mix is caramel flavored that I achieved with a specific extract. The icing is also caramel flavored, plain and simple. Then the 
topping is pure homemade caramel I made in a sauce pan with sea salt flakes sprinkled on top. Besides that on top is plenty of caramel
focused candies and foods to just add dimension, layers, and decoration.</p>
